    <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This class is a first step into JavaScript. It is not a complete reference, but it is enough to get started.</p>
    <p>JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly. It can also be used to change the appearance of a web page through dynamically manipulating the DOM. Finally, JavaScript can also be used to communicate with servers, commonly known as AJAX, and retrieve new information without having to refresh the page.</p>
